 <img src="img/meatballs.webp" alt="Meatballs" width="300px" height="200px">
  <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
  <ul>
  <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

<li>1 ¼ pounds 93%-lean ground turkey</li>

<li>⅓ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>

<li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
  </ul> 

  <h2>Description</h2>
<H3>Step 1</H3>
<p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
<H3>Step 2</H3>
<p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with oil, and place it into the oven while preheating.</p>
<H3>Step 3</H3>
<p>Mix turkey, bread crumbs, and egg together in a bowl with your hands.</p>
<H3>Step 4</H3>
<p>Using an ice cream scoop if possible, form mixture into golf ball-sized meatballs. Place meatballs into the hot dish, about 1 inch apart. Press gently on each meatball to flatten the bottom just slightly.</p>
<H3>Step 5</H3>
<p>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Flip meatballs over and continue baking until somewhat crispy on the outside, about 5 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
<H3>Step 6</H3>
<p>Serve with pasta or sauce, or however you'd like.</p>
